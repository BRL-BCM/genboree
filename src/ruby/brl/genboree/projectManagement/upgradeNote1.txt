With the new support for sub-projects, the standard project subdirectories Genboree
uses have been RENAMED to better protect against users using those same names for
their own sub-projects. The RENAMING adds a highly-Genboree specific prefix (genb^^).
For robustness, however, new projects/subprojects will be not be allowed to use these
names.

To upgrade existing projects:

1) Update any projects that have files in SVN (generally under "additional") using SVN.
Do this by cd to the project directory and doing the svn update.

2) To convert the rest:

for xx in `find . -type d -name required -o -name optional -o -name additionalPages -o -name additionalFiles -o -name BAK`
do
  yy=`echo $xx | ruby -pae '$_ =~ /required|optional|additionalPages|additionalFiles|BAK/ ; rr=$&; $_.gsub!(/#{rr}/, "genb^^#{rr}")' `
  mv $xx $yy
done
