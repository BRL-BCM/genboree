In order to generate the output files for each separate track, the source code *.rb and *.gz input file for each correspondent track should be located in the same directory with the main source file.  The main source file BRL_UCSC_structuralVariants.rb can be run one time to generate 1+ tracks by giving appropriate input flag (See USAGE info in the file). The program package has been tested, and all input and output files are located under /users/ybai/work/Structural_Variants_Combine/
