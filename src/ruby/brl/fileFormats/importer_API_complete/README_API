Start MySQL if not by typing-
./bin/mysqld_safe --user=root &

Function:
#####################
The file "BRL_UCSC_importer_API_complete.rb" takes the user input of a genome assembly version and/or remote UCSC track information, and download the correct file(s) for the track(s) and after downloading them, converts them automatically to LFF, finally load the converted file into Genboree through REST_based API.

To run correctly,
All sources files including downloader and converter files, "BRL_UCSC_importer_API_complete.rb", and "data_acquisition_complete_data.txt", "BRL_UCSC_universial_downloader.rb", "BRL_UCSC_fosmidlff.rb", "BRL_UCSC_chimpchainlff.rb", ..., should be put in the same direcory in a machine with MySQL server installed in order to run them successfully.

Note: Intended loading database and the project on the server side need to be created first before running the program.

#####################

The features of this software package will be implemented:
######################
Given a environmental variable ("GENB_RC") that points to personal Genboree configuration file (~/.genbrc), the program will verify that the file is -owned- by the user running the process and that it has exactly the UNIX permission 600 (read and write by user only, nobody else) before reading the contents.
---FUNCTION 0---
Put project description through resource path:  
/REST/v1/grp/{grp}/prj/{prj}/description? 
	prj = 'UCSC Importer Tool'
	description = "Download UCSC tracks and convert them into Genboree LFF format and upload the LFF file(s) into Genboree through REST API"
---FUNCTION 1---
Given an user and an input group name, it will check whether this user is within {grp} through resource path:
/REST/v1/grp/{grp}/usr/{usr}
---FUNCTION 2---
Given group name and database name/version, it will find out whether it is available in database reservoir on server side through resource path:
/REST/v1/grp/{grp}/db/{db}
---FUNCTION 3---
Given input track name, it will verify whether it is already in that database by getting the information through resource path:
/REST/v1/grp/{grp}/db/{db}/trk/{trk}
If yes, delete (update) it and put this track through resource path if its track name has been given appropriately (with verification functionality):
/REST/v1/grp/{grp}
/db/{db}/annos

Other features are:
/REST/v1/grp/{grp}/db/{db}/trk/{trk}/description 	
GET È track description. If not,
PUT È new description
DELETE È track description

/REST/v1/grp/{grp}/db/{db}/trk/{trk}/url  	
GET È track URL. If not,
PUT È a new track URL (in request body).
Or if inappropriate, 
DELETE È track URL

/REST/v1/grp/{grp}
/db/{db}/trk/{trk}/urlLabel 	
GET È track URL label text. If not,
PUT È a new track URL label text(in request body).
Or if inappropriate,
DELETE È track URL label text

Databases can be created on the Genboree server side (See the inside of file "data_acquisition_complete_data.txt" to find out associated with tracks):
