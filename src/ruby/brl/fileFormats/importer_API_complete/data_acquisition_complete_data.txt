A BAC typically consists of 50 - 300 kb of DNA. During the early phase of a sequencing project, it is common to sequence a single read (approximately 500 bases) off each end of a large number of BACs. Later on in the project, these BAC end reads can be mapped to the genome sequence. This track shows these mappings in cases where both ends could be mapped. These BAC end pairs can be useful for validating the assembly over relatively long ranges. In some cases, the BACs are useful biological reagents. This track can also be used for determining which BAC contains a given gene, useful information for certain wet lab experiments.

This is a moderately conservative set of predictions, requiring the support of one GenBank RNA sequence plus at least one additional line of evidence. The RefSeq RNAs are an exception to this, requiring no additional evidence. The track includes both protein-coding and putative non-coding transcripts. Some of these non-coding transcripts may actually code for protein, but the evidence for the associated protein is weak at best. Compared to RefSeq, this gene set has generally about 10% more protein-coding genes, approximately five times as many putative non-coding genes, and about twice as many splice variants.

A BAC typically consists of 25 - 350 kb of DNA. During the early phase of a sequencing project, it is common to sequence a single read (approximately 500 bases) off each end of a large number of BACs. Later on in the project, these BAC end reads can be mapped to the genome sequence.

The program outputs a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence, as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked. RepeatMasker uses the RepBase library of repeats from the Genetic Information Research Institute (GIRI). RepBase is described in Jurka, J. (2000) in the References section below.
